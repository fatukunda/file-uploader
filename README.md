# File-uploader - [production link](https://file-upload-manager.netlify.app/)

## How to Run

- Clone the repo by running the command `git clone git@github.com:fatukunda/file-uploader.git` on your terminal.
- Install dependencies by running `yarn add`.
- Run the app by running `yarn serve` on your terminal.
- Click on the `+` icon on the nav bar to simulate the upload process.

### Libraries used

- Vuex - For state management. I used vuex because it makes it easier to share state with different components that are in this application. Also, it hides away most of the functionality from the components hence making them more readable.
- Vuetify - My choice for Vuetify was mostly based on the fact that it provides all the necessary components that I needed to complete the project. It is also required by FireKamp so I wanted to show that I can work with it.

### What I would do if I had more time

- Pay more attention to component re-usability.
- Complete all the tasks.
- Write unit tests.
